### The "new" old site

I was looking at one of my websites, [MarvelDCfilms.com](https://www.Marveldcfilms.com){:target="_blank" __}, that i have been working on for a couple of years now.
Currently the site is "under construction", more like "under highway construction" since i haven't worked on it in a while.
I have the frame of what i want it to be like, but i never really like that there were too many files with a lot of content to work on.
By switching to Jekyll there will probably be just as many, if not more, file as the current form of it, but they will be easier to manage.
I could divide all markdown files into "/MCU/, /DCU/, /XMEN/..." those could be the main folders per Cinematic Universe and within i could have subfolders with
"/Characters/, /Timeline/, etc". This will make the whole process a lot easier for adding more content and making quick changes.

***But first*** i have to finish **This** site. I am still trying to get my blog finished.

### This blog

I am probably going to be "reposting" my entries on tumblr too just so i could reach a bigger audience.
