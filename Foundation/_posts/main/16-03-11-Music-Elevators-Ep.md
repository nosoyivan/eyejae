    My buddy Oscar Garcia put out his debut Ep 'Elevators' a couple of weeks ago. The album feels like a modern mixture of Jazz and Hip-Hop with a French neo-noir undertone. I might be a little bias by saying how much i enjoyed it, but i really love seeing my friends create awesome content. Whether it is an awesome Ep, a drawing, a video, or even a well made meal. When i know the person who put hard work into it i tend to appreciate it a bit more. With that being said, i will now go into a small breakdown of what enjoyed about it.
